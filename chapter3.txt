Kakashi Hatake is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Hatake clan. Famed as Kakashi of the Sharingan, he is one of Konoha's most talented ninja, regularly looked to for advice and leadership despite his personal dislike of responsibility. To his students on Team 7, Kakashi teaches the importance of teamwork, a lesson he received, along with the Sharingan, from his childhood friend, Obito Uchiha. After the Fourth Shinobi World War, Kakashi becomes Konoha's Sixth Hokage.

Abilities:

One of the strongest ninja Konohagakure ever produced, Kakashi has earned recognition on sight by various high-level ninja.[43] A prodigy, Kakashi showcased highly advanced skill from a young age,[44] evidenced by his rapid rise through the ninja ranks.[45] His prowess is said to take on an entire country.[46] The S-Rank members of Akatsuki acknowledge his might;[47] he outmanoeuvred Itachi Uchiha (albeit he couldn't use his Mangekyō Sharingan at the time) fought Kisame Hoshigaki and Kakuzu respectively to a standstill, and deemed a major threat by Pain.[48] Kakashi's combat prowess and leadership skills are so revered, that many foresaw his rise to Hokage status years before it happened.[49] However, the Sage of Six Paths believed Kakashi's greatest strength is as a teacher, leader, and friend, all of which proved vital in Kaguya Ōtsutsuki's defeat.[50] Years after Kaguya's defeat, Kakashi's combat power significantly increased further, even after he lost his Sharingan.[51]

In general, Kakashi is very versatile with advanced proficiency in countless areas including mastery of all three main ninja skills; Naruto Uzumaki says Kakashi is smarter than Shikamaru Nara, has a better sense of smell than Kiba Inuzuka, is more adept with the Sharingan than Sasuke Uchiha, and has better taijutsu skill than Rock Lee, each of whom are well-known for their high capacities in their respective areas.[52] Kakashi's genjutsu prowess is able to use basic techniques to major effect for intimidation and distraction.
